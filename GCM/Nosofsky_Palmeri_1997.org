#+TITLE: An Exemplar-Based Random Walk Model of Speeded Classification Notes

** Abstract
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
The authors propose and test an exemplar-based random walk model for predicting response times
in tasks of speeded, multidimensional perceptual classification. The model combines elements of
R.M. Nosofsky's (1986) generalized context model of categorization and G.D. Logan's (1988)
instance-based model of automaticity. In the model, exemplars race among one another to be retrieved
from memory, with rates determined by their similarity to test items. The retrieved exemplars provide
incremental information that enters into a random walk process for making classification decisions.
The model predicts correctly effects of within- and between-categories similarity, individual-object
familiarity, and extended practice on classification response times. It also builds bridges between
the domains of categorization and automaticity.
