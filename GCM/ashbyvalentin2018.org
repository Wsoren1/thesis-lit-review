** Abstract
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
The long history of categorization experiments indicates that many important design choices
can critically affect the quality of the resulting data. Unfortunately, the optimal choices depend
on the goals of the experiment, so there is no single template that a new researcher can follow.
This chapter describes methods needed to design effective categorization experiments, and spe-
cialized methods for analyzing the resulting data. First, a number of important experimental
design choices are discussed, including: 1) whether a categorization or identification experi-
ment is more appropriate, 2) what type of category structure should be used, 3) how to choose
the stimuli, 4) how to construct the categories so they have optimal statistical properties, 5) how
to present feedback following each response, and 5) design choices that make it easy to assess
participant performance. Second, several specialized methods for analyzing categorization data
are described, including forward and backward learning curves, and a statistical procedure for
strategy analysis that can identify participants who were guessing, using a single-cue explicit
rule, or using some multi-cue similarity-based strategy.
