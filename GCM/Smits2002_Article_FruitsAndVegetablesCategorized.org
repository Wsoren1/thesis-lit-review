** Abstract
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
In the study reported in this paper, we investigated the categorization of well-known and novel food
items in the categories fruits and vegetables. Predictions based on Nosofskyâ€™s (1984, 1986) generalized
context model (GCM), on a multiplicative-similarity prototype model, and on an instantiation model as
applied in Storms, De Boeck, and Ruts (2001) were compared. Despite suggestions in the literature that
prototype models predict categorization from large categories better than exemplar models do, our re-
sults showed that the exemplar-based GCM yielded clearly better predictions than did a (multiplicative-
similarity) prototype model.
