** Abstract
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
An overview of a simulation model of human memory is presented. The model assumes:
(1) that only episodic traces are stored in memory, (2) that repetition produces multiple traces
of an item, (3) that a retrieval cue contacts all memory traces simultaneously, (4) that each
trace is activated according to its similarity to the retrieval cue, and (5) that all traces respond
in parallel, the retrieved information reflecting their summed output. The model has been ap-
plied with success to a variety of phenomena found with human subjects in frequency and rec-
ognition judgment tasks, the schema-abstraction task, and paired-associate learning. Applica-
tion of the model to these tasks is briefly summarized.
