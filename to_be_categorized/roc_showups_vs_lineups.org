** Abstract
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Showups (a one-person identification) were compared to both simultaneous and sequential lineups that
varied in lineup fairness and the position of the suspect in the lineup. We reanalyzed data from a study
by Gronlund, Carlson, Dailey, and Goodsell (2009), which included simultaneous and sequential lineups,
and using the same stimuli and procedures, collected new data using showup identifications. Perfor-
mance was compared using ROC analysis, which is superior to traditional measures such as correct and
false identification rates, and probative value measures. ROC analysis showed that simultaneous lineups
consistently produced more accurate identification evidence than showups, but sequential lineups were
sometimes no more accurate than showups, and were never more accurate than simultaneous lineups.
These results supported prior suppositions regarding the suggestiveness of showups, revealed a mis-
conception about the superiority of sequential lineups, and demonstrated why eyewitness identification
procedures need to be evaluated using ROC analyses.
