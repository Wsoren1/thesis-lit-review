** Abstract
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
J.P. Minda and J. D. Smith (2001) showed that a prototype model outperforms an exemplar model,
especially in larger categories or categories that contained more complex stimuli. R. M. Nosofsky and
S.R. Zaki (2002) showed that an exemplar model with a response-scaling mechanism outperforms a
prototype model. The authors of the current study investigated whether excessive model flexibility could
explain these results. Using cross-validation, the authors demonstrated that both the prototype model and
the exemplar model with a response-scaling mechanism suffered from overfitting in the linearly
separable category structure. The results illustrate the need to make sure that the best-fitting model is not
chasing error variance instead of variance attributed to the cognitive process it is supposed to model
