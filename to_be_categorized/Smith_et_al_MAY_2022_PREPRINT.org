** Abstract
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Visual recognition memory has a remarkable capacity to discriminate between what has been
seen before and what has not been seen before. Yet, research on eyewitness lineups suggests that
eyewitness memory is useful for detecting the presence of the culprit in a lineup, but less useful
for detecting the absence of the culprit. We show that this asymmetry is predicted by the equal-
variance signal-detection model. When witnesses reject lineups, they provide a global confidence
rating that none of the lineup members is the culprit. Global confidence ratings do not scale
match-to-memory for the suspect and are low in diagnostic value. For this reason, the equal-
variance signal-detection model predicts the superiority of a one-person showup over a standard
six-person simultaneous lineup. A large-scale experiment (N = 3281) confirms that showups
have better discriminability than do standard simultaneous lineups. However, a modified lineup
in which participants were asked to follow categorical identification decisions by assigning a
confidence rating to each lineup member had better discriminability than both the showup and
the standard simultaneous lineup. We call this modified lineup the rule out procedure. Results
also revealed a relatively weak confidence-accuracy relation for global rejections of lineups, but
a much stronger confidence-accuracy relation for rejections of individual faces. These findings
suggest that past failures to detect suspect innocence with eyewitness lineups were attributable to
a flaw in the design of simultaneous lineups and not to limitations of visual recognition memory.
The rule out procedure might become the gold standard for collecting identification evidence.

* Notes
** Research Question

Eyewitness lineups suffer from relative judgement masking information about the suspect in the event of a rejected lineup.  In these cases, eyewitness is considered "neutral evidence."  In showups, this does not happen, as suspect judgement of confidence is directly reported.

Would a "rule-out" procedure appended to the end of a simultaneous offer the same discriminability as a showup
