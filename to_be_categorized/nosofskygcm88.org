** Abstract
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Previously published sets of classification and old-new recognition memory data are reanalyzed
within the framework of an exemplar-based generalization model. The key assumption in the
model is that, whereas classification decisions are based on the similarity of a probe to exemplars
of a target category relative to exemplars of contrast categories, recognition decisions are based
on overall summed similarity of a probe to all exemplars. The summed-similarity decision rule
is shown to be consistent with a wide variety ofrecognition memory data obtained in classification
learning situations and may provide a unified approach to understanding relations between
categorization and recognition.
