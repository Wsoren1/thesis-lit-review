#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
In a novel version of the classic dot-pattern prototype-distortion paradigm of category learning, Homa et
al. (2019) tested a condition in which individual training instances never repeated, and observed results
that they claimed severely challenged exemplar models of classification and recognition. Among the
results was a dissociation in which participants classified transfer items with high accuracy in the no-
repeat condition, yet in old-new recognition tests showed no ability to discriminate between old and
new items of the same level of distortion from the prototype. In addition, speed of classification learning
was no faster in a condition in which a small set of training instances was repeated continuously com-
pared with the no-repeat condition. Here we show through computer-simulation modeling that exemplar
models naturally capture the classification-recognition dissociation in the no-repeat condition, as well as
a wide variety of other qualitative effects reported by Homa et al. (2019). We also conduct new concep-
tual-replication experiments to investigate their reported null effect of repeated versus nonrepeated train-
ing instances on speed of classification learning. In contrast to Homa et al. (2019) we find that speed of
learning is substantially faster in the repeat condition than in the no-repeat condition, precisely as exem-
plar models predict. The exemplar model also captures a wide variety of transfer effects observed fol-
lowing the completion of category learning, including the classification-recognition dissociation
observed across the repeat and no-repeat conditions.
