** Abstract
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Tests of formal models of human categorization have
traditionally been restricted to artificial categories because
deriving psychological representations for large numbers of
natural stimuli has been an intractable task. We show that deep
learning may be used to solve this problem. We train an
ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to produce
the multidimensional scaling (MDS) coordinates of images of
rocks. We then show that not only are the CNNs able to predict
the MDS coordinates of a held-out test set of rocks, but that the
CNN-derived representations can be used in combination with
a formal psychological model to predict human categorization
behavior on a completely new set of rocks.
